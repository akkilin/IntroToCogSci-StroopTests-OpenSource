# IntroToCogSci-StroopTests-OpenSource
 Final Coding Project for Introduction to Cognitive Science course at RPI. Open Source, but only for academic purposes.
  - Modifying the code for Open Source and Research is under academic purposes.
  - Reusing written code for your school projects and calling it your own is not under academic purposes. 
  Please give us some form of credit like putting us in the references.
    Thank You (Alan W & Matt P).

Pygame Version:

* Note: StroopTestColorsColors is the most understandable one in terms of organized code.
